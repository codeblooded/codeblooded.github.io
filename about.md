#### Why do you post your faith?

It's very important to me. I don't force my faith on anyone.  Many can attest to this, because many of my friends have different beliefs.  I have agnostic, Muslim, Jewish, and athiest friends.  I also have Christian friends.  I love everyone the same.

A lot has happened in my life.  At the age of 8, I lost my home and everything I knew in Hurricane Katrina.  My trials did not end here, because some of my relatives began spiraling into bad health.  I lost them.  __My faith__ is the _only_ thing that has gotten me through.

Many people say that you cannot be a scientist and a Christian.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  I love Science and Mathematics.  I also love my God.  I feel like I learn more about Him in the midst of scientific discoveries.  I know many people who feel this way, too. 

I don't post it for attention.  Honestly, I don't really want the attention.  Most of it is negative, anyway.  I post it, because I thank God for my opportunities to explore Computer Science. It came at a time in my life when I really needed it, too!

#### How long have you been interested in Computer Science?

Since birth.  As a little boy, I remember playing on an NEC with Dial-Up internet.  Yea, I don't think many in my generation can say this.  I always wanted to know how programs worked, and I always looked for answers.
