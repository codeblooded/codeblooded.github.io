  Christian, Computer Science Student, Software Engineer, Bison & Aggie (A-Whoop)!
</span>

As a little boy, I remember playing on an NEC with AOL Dial-Up internet. I donâ€™t think many in my generation can say that. I have
been interested in technology as long as I can remember. I always wanted to know how the world around me works, how it can be improved,
and I've been searching for answers ever since.

I was incredibly blessed to start Computer Science classes and made
lifelong friends at [Lipscomb University](http://lipscomb.edu). From age 14, I like to say they taught me most of what I know! I'm currently a proud senior, Computer Science major at [Texas
A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/).  I'm a member of the [ACM](http://acm.org) and [IEEE](http://ieee.org), and hoping to get into research as an undergraduate. I have interned with [Faithlife](http://faithlife.com) in Bellingham, WA and [IBM](http://ibm.com) / [The Weather Company](http://www.theweathercompany.com/) in Austin, TX. I have also done some work as a freelancer.

I'm a Christian, and my faith is an critical part of my life. Through the challenges, I feel like God is the only strength which gets me through. I'm a huge Christian Music fan, and grew up listening to [LifeSongs 89.1FM New Orleans](http://lifesongs.com), [WayFM 88.7FM Nashville](http://wayfm.com), and [The Fish 94.1FM Nashville](http://www.94fmthefish.net/). I've been incredibly inspired and blessed by sermons from [Erwin McManus](https://youtube.com/watch?v=o_vIiezUR1s) and [Louie Giglio](https://youtube.com/watch?v=iYFHQzLp4fM). I highly recommend you check them out when you need some uplifting.

In my freetime, I hunt around for cool projects and learn new things on [GitHub](https://github.com/codeblooded?tab=stars). My interests vary on a continual basis, and so you can find an updated list [here](/interests).

Recently, I've also gotten into some [podcasts](/podcasts).

That's enough about me! What about you?
