This past weekend, I started on my computer science project. I was completely stumped. I had no idea where to go, and I spent countless hours dreading what I thought I would have to do. I was convinced that the most obvious solution was problematic.  So, I kept engineering around it.  Hour after hour, I didn't make any progress. 

This isn't the first time this happened. I imagine it's relatively common for software engineers.

I should have just plugged and tried to make the original solution work. As the deadline approached, I became desperate. So, I decided to go back to the original concept.

To my shock, it totally worked! I had no idea! God showed me that I should never assume anything is impossible. If any other engineer assumed this, we wouldn't have anything, right?

I found God showing me love in Computer Science and teaching me lessons through it.
