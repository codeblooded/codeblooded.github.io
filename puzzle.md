During my stay in Bellingham, I enjoyed posting puzzles in Faithlife's intern channel on Flowdock.  Obviously, this is just for fun.  I like making them, and it makes me think of clever ways to solve problems.  This is an adaption of one of the early ones, but it is not what it seems.  Good luck if you attempt it.

## Riddles Can Be the Opposite of the Expected

If you can figure this one out, I'll be impressed.

<pre class="one inverted container">
b2 86 df 8a 8c 9a df 96 8c df 8e 8a 96 8b 9a df 96 92 8f 8d 9a 8c 8c 96 89 9a d3 f2 f5 ab 97 9a df 9a 91 89 96 8d 90 91 92 9a 91 8b df b6 df 9b 90 df 9c 90 91 8b 9e 96 91 d3 f2 f5 ac 90 92 9a df 8d 90 9b 9a 91 8b 8c df 88 8d 96 8b 9a df 92 86 df 9d 9e 8c 9a d3 f2 f5 9d 8a 8b df b2 9e 9a 8d 8c 94 df 96 8c df 91 90 8b df 92 86 df 91 9e 92 9a d1

The answer will require knowledge of modern tools, hex conversion to/from ASCII, and, perhaps, the opposite of what you know is true. Yes, there is a hint hidden on this page.

If you figure it out, tweet it and mention me!
